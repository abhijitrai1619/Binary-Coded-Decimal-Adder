    -- NOTE: The following assignments are syntactically incorrect and redundant:
    -- These lines are trying to assign input ports to themselves.
    -- They should be removed or replaced with proper full adder instantiation below.
    -- a <= x;
    -- b <= y;
    -- cin <= cin;
    -- s <= s;
    -- cout <= cout;

    -- Instead, you need to instantiate four full adders and wire them correctly.
    -- Here's an example of what that structure *should* look like:
    --
    -- FA0: four_bit_adder port map (a => x(0), b => y(0), cin => cin, s => s(0), cout => carry(0));
    -- FA1: four_bit_adder port map (a => x(1), b => y(1), cin => carry(0), s => s(1), cout => carry(1));
    -- FA2: four_bit_adder port map (a => x(2), b => y(2), cin => carry(1), s => s(2), cout => carry(2));
    -- FA3: four_bit_adder port map (a => x(3), b => y(3), cin => carry(2), s => s(3), cout => cout);
    --
    -- You must manually write these port maps or use a generate block in more advanced versions.
