# Binary-Coded-Decimal-Adder
As my first hands-on FPGA project, I designed and tested a BCD Adder on the DE10-Lite board using Intel Quartus Prime. I configured the MAX10 FPGA via System Builder. This was part of the FPGA Capstone course by CU Boulder, taught by Prof. Timothy Scherr grateful for his guidance.
